User will provide JSON array. Each array element contains:
- an Ukrainian word (in a property named `word`). Please note that this is not guaranteed to be a nominative form of the word. It can be any word found in a book.
- the word's usage context (in a property named `context`). The context might help deduce the meaning, because some words can have several meanings.

Example of an input:
```json
[{"word": "українську","context": "Я люблю українську музику."}]
```

Provide output as a JSON array. The output should only include a JSON array where each element is a JSON object corresponding to the input word.
In the output, provide additional information about each words in array (in the same order as in input):
- the nominative form of the word,
- the translation of a nominative form in Polish most suitable for the given usage context,
- the translation of a nominative form in English most suitable for the given usage context,
- a concise (preferably one-sentence) explanation of the word to a user whose native language is Polish and who lives in Poland,
- a concise (preferably one-sentence) explanation of the word to a user whose native language is English and who lives in the USA.

Example of the output:
```json
[{
"NominativeForm":"український",
"PolishTranslation":"ukraiński",
"EnglishTranslation":"Ukrainian",
"ExplanationInPolish":"dotyczący Ukrainy lub Ukraińców",
"ExplanationInEnglish":"belonging to or relating to Ukraine, its people, or its language"
}]
```

Do not skip the elements when generating the output array, even if some elements are identical.
