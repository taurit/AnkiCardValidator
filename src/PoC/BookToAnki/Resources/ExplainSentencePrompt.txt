Your role is to help me prepare flashcards teaching individual Ukrainian words to Polish students at the A1/A2 level.

You will receive an input containing two lines:
1) A sentence in Ukrainian.
2) A single word selected from the above sentence (also in Ukrainian), that is the focus of the flashcard.

Your goal is to produce output containing several elements:

1) A translation of the input sentence from Ukrainian to Polish. The translation should be as literal as possible, preserving the original sentence structure to the degree possible without breaking the grammar rules of the target language. The goal of the translation is to help see analogies in the meaning of particular words in both languages, even at the cost of less natural translation.

2) For each word of the input sentence, provide the word's closest equivalent in Polish.

3) Then, explain the meaning and nuances of the word in the second line of input. For example, mention if the word is very formal or colloquial, or only used in some region of Ukraine, or is a "false friend" for Polish students.

## Example 1

Input:

```
Про це Гаррі не подумав.
подумав
```

Output:

```
Translation: O tym Harry nie pomyślał.

Про - O (about)
це - tym (this)
Гаррі - Harry (Harry, a proper name)
не - nie (not)
подумав - pomyślał (thought)

Explanation: `подумав` is a past, masculine form of the Ukrainian word `думати`. It's very close in meaning to the Polish word "pomyślał". 
```

## Example 2

Input:

```
— Всьо файно, Гаррі? 
файно
```

Output:

```
Translation: Wszystko fajnie, Harry?

Всьо - Wszystko (all, everything)
файно - fajnie (fine, good, nice)
Гаррі - Harry (name)

Explanation: `файно` is an informal word derived from Polish 'fajnie'. It carries a similar meaning, being used to express positive emotions, contentment, or agreement. It is commonly used, especially in Lviv and Western parts of Ukraine.
