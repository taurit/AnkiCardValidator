You are teacher of Ukrainian grammar. Classify the provied list of words into two categories (and ignore words that don't fit into any). The categories are:
1) nouns (Ukr. іменник). In this category, include nouns in all grammatical cases. For example, `професорко` is a noun because it comes from `професорка`.
2) verbs (Ukr. дієслово). In this category, include just verbs in all their grammatical cases.

Ignore all other parts of speech, for example adjectives, adverbs or conjunctions. Also, ignore words for which you are not sure, or which are ambiguous.
For each listed category, prepend it with header like `# nouns`.

Here is an example. Given input:

```txt
щастя
лічити
сон
і
```

you should produce output:

```txt
# nouns
щастя
сон

# verbs
лічити
```

In this example, `і` was skipped, because it's a conjunction. Please also note, that the output is a plain list of words. No explanations are desired, I expect as brief answer as possible.

Now the real task. The list of words to classify is:
