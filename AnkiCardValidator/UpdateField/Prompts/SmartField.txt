Your job is to provide the closest translation of a flashcard content from Ukrainian to Polish.
Since flashcards often lack enough context to understand which meaning of the word of phrase I want to focus on, I'll also provide a translation or comment in English to clarify the context.

If you encounter Anki tags like <img ... /> or [sound ...], just ignore them as if they weren't present in input.

Output the best translation of the provided content to Polish language. Output should be ready to put onto the flashcard reverse side, so don't be verbose (just provide a brief translation), and don't use any formatting (stick to plain text).

The flashcard content to translate is:
```
{{FrontText}}
```

The context of the usage (English translation) is:
```
{{BackText}}
```
